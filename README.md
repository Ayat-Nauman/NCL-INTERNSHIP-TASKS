## 🚀 Completed Tasks

### 🔹 STM32 Programming Basics
- Implemented LED blinking, watchdog timer, DMA, interrupts, and GPIO functionalities.  
- Tools: STM32 Cube Programmer, STM32 Cube IDE, STM32 Cube MX.  

### 🔹 STM32 Security Features
- Studied STM32 security features using online tutorials and playlists.  
- No practical task was assigned due to unavailability of original boards.  

### 🔹 Hex File Extraction
- Extracted hex files from Arduino and ESP32 boards using **AVRDUDESS**.  
- Uploaded extracted firmware to new boards successfully.  
- Extracted and reprogrammed hex files from HM-Elevator PCB.  

### 🔹 Flash Memory Integration – Solar Plasma Generator
- Implemented flash memory storage for saving HMI inputs on STM32.  
- Enabled parameter retention after system restart.  
- Later replaced by SD card integration.  

### 🔹 HMI Design
- Designed **UI for Solar Plasma Generator** using Canva.  
- Implemented HMI design in **Nextion Editor**.  

### 🔹 Circuit Debugging & Communication
- Assisted in debugging the Solar Plasma Generator replica circuit.  
- Implemented STM32 ↔ HMI communication for reading and writing parameter values.  

### 🔹 Research Contributions
- Conducted preliminary research and cost estimation for **Chaseup ESL Project**.  
- Collected and prepared technical content for the **Solar Plasma Generator Website**.
